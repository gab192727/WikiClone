                This website (the “Application”) is a student-demo project built with Django for educational purposes.
                We
                respect the privacy of all visitors.

                            (no

                            the
                            Wikipedia and Wiktionary APIs.</li>
                        <li>Because no personal information is collected, encrypted, or transferred to external parties
                            (other
                            than
                            the publicly accessible APIs), there are no user profiles or personal data warehouses.</li>
